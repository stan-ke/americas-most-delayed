# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## What this is

"America's Most Delayed" — a wall of shame for late public transit. A single Rust
binary crate (`server`, edition 2024) that continuously polls hundreds of
GTFS-realtime feeds, prints a live leaderboard of the most-delayed trips across
every agency it can reach, and serves that data over an HTTP + WebSocket API.

It ships as **two halves**: this crate (the dynamic API, on a VPS) and the pages in
**`../static/`** (on GitHub Pages, free). The server serves no HTML — see "The two
halves" below, and `../static/README.md` for deployment.

## Commands

- Build: `cargo build`
- Run: `cargo run` — long-running. It fetches the live feed catalogs (Transitland
  Atlas + MobilityData) over the network at startup, then polls live feeds forever
  (Ctrl-C to stop) while
  serving the API on `:8080`. A background census downloads every agency's static
  GTFS zip once into `./feeds/` (git-ignored) to count its trips, so the first run
  pulls a lot over the network; cached zips are reused until they age past 24h.
- Debug capture: `AMD_DEBUG=1 cargo run` adds a per-row 🐛 button to the
  leaderboard page that zips one entry's full data (config, live GTFS-RT, static
  GTFS, computed delay) into `./debug/` (git-ignored) for offline debugging. See
  the API/frontend section.
- Lint / format: `cargo clippy`, `cargo fmt`

- The pages: serve `../static/` with any static file server (`python3 -m http.server
  3000`). `config.js` points itself at `http://localhost:8080` when the page is
  served from localhost, so a local `cargo run` is all it needs.

There is **no test suite** yet — `cargo test` runs nothing. Verify changes by
running the binary and watching the leaderboard output, or hitting the API:
`curl localhost:8080/api/status` and a websocket client on
`ws://localhost:8080/api/subscribe`.

Note when running under a wrapper: `cargo run` spawns the `server` binary as a
child, so a `timeout`/kill on `cargo` can orphan the running server. Run the
built binary directly (`./target/debug/server`) when you need a hard timeout.

## Architecture

The pipeline is: **catalog → agency configs → dynamic parallel polling →
realtime feeds → delay computation → provenance vetting → leaderboard → delta
stream → API**.

The whole binary is **async** (Tokio, `#[tokio::main]`). `main.rs` awaits the
catalog fetch, then `scheduler::start` spawns the polling tasks and returns the
shared `Arc<Scheduler>`; `api::serve` runs the server on that handle, and the
process stays alive for as long as it serves.

### Agency configuration and the `partial_config!` macro

`AgencyConfig` (in `agency.rs`) is the unit of "one feed we monitor". It and its
all-fields-optional twin `PartialAgencyConfig` are **both generated from a single
field list** by the `partial_config!` macro in `macros.rs`. Add a config field in
one place there; the macro derives the complete struct, the partial struct, the
`merge_other` logic (combining partial configs, `self` wins on conflict), and the
`upgrade_to_complete` logic (`required` fields error if missing). This exists
because a single agency's data is assembled from multiple catalog rows.

`catalogs/mobilitydata.rs` fetches MobilityData's `feeds_v2.csv`, turns every row
into a `PartialAgencyConfig`, then **merges static-feed and realtime-feed rows
into one complete config** keyed by `static_reference`. Entries with both a static
URL and a trip-updates URL become normal pollable configs via
`upgrade_to_complete`. An entry that has a static feed but **no paired realtime
feed** isn't dropped: if its catalog status is `active`, it's kept as a
**static-only config** (built by hand with an empty realtime URL set) so it can
surface in `/status` as `no_realtime` — this is how a large agency the catalog is
missing GTFS-realtime for (e.g. TTC, CTA, Muni, GO Transit — the reason NJ Transit
is hand-configured) becomes visible rather than silently absent. Deprecated/
inactive/dev static feeds are dropped; only rows with neither a realtime nor a
static feed are truly skipped.

`catalogs/transitland.rs` is a second catalog source: the **Transitland Atlas**
(<https://github.com/transitland/transitland-atlas>), published as a GitHub repo
of **DMFR** JSON files. The provider downloads the repo zip, reads every
`feeds/*.dmfr.json`, and pairs feeds through **operators** rather than a
`static_reference` column — an operator's `associated_feeds` (explicit, or
implicit when the operator is nested inside a feed) point at a static
`static_current` feed and/or a realtime `realtime_trip_updates` feed. In two
passes it builds a **pollable** config when a static and a realtime feed are
present (deduped on the realtime URL so a regional feed shared by many operators is
polled once), then a **static-only** (`no_realtime`) config for operators that have
a static feed but no realtime — mirroring MobilityData, so a big agency Transitland
lacks realtime for still surfaces. A multi-modal operator is **`decompose`d into
one config per realtime mode** (subway / bus / rail…, keyed by `mode_key` on the
feed id) rather than collapsing to whichever feed is listed first: each mode group
takes the static whose id best matches that mode (`pick_static`), merges all its
trip-updates URLs (the scheduler polls the whole `Vec`), and is name/slug-suffixed
with a mode label so the same-agency dedup keeps the siblings apart (they'd
otherwise collapse — see the parenthetical rule in `main.rs`). This is how SEPTA
surfaces as *(bus)* + *(rail)* and MTA as *(subway)* + *(bus)*. A mode whose
realtime feeds are **all** auth-gated (MTA buses via BusTime) keeps those feeds and
becomes `requires_auth` rather than vanishing; a mode with any pollable feed drops
its auth-gated ones. Feeds flagged stale in
`tags.status` (outdated/archived/unpublished) are skipped. Country isn't in DMFR,
so `country_code` decodes the Onestop ID's geohash (`o-<geohash>-<name>`) with the
`geohash` crate and reverse-geocodes the point to an ISO country code with the
`reverse_geocoder` crate (offline, worldwide) — a general lat/lon→country helper,
not North-America-specific. The decoded point is also kept as the config's
`location` ([`GeoPoint`], microdegrees so the config stays `Eq`), used for dedup;
MobilityData fills `location` from each feed's bounding-box center.

`main.rs` draws from an ordered, editable `CATALOG_SOURCES` list of a
`CatalogSource` enum (currently `[Transitland, MobilityData]`) — reorder to change
which catalog wins duplicates, or delete a line to use just one. `collect_agencies`
tries `agency::nj_transit()` first (it's in no catalog, so it always wins), then
each source in order; a source that fails to load is logged and skipped, not fatal.
It **country-filters to North America first**, then dedupes across sources in two
passes:

- **Exact-match pass** — drop a config whose slug, static-feed URL, or realtime
  URL an earlier (more-preferred) one already claimed. Precise: shared URLs are
  definitely the same feed.
- **Same-agency pass** — collapse the *same real agency* listed under different
  names/ids/URLs across catalogs (e.g. "Valley Metro" and "Valley Metro (VM)").
  `Identity::same_agency` matches on: equal base name (parenthetical stripped) +
  country, **compatible parentheticals** (equal, or absent on one side), and
  **locations within `DEDUP_RADIUS_KM` (150km)**. The location check is what keeps
  genuinely distinct same-named agencies apart — two far-flung "Valley Transit"s,
  or BC Transit's regional systems (whose differing parentheticals also separate
  them). It's generic, not per-agency. Within a match it keeps the **most useful**
  feed (pollable > auth-gated > static-only), so a dedup never trades a live feed
  for a dead one. (A feed missing a `location` can't be matched here — ~13% of
  MobilityData feeds lack a bounding box — so a few cross-catalog dups survive.)

Feeds the scheduler won't poll — **auth-gated** (`requires_auth()`) and
**static-only** (`!has_trip_updates()`) — still pass through, so `/status` reports
them as `requires_auth` / `no_realtime`. The scheduler decides pollability per
source: only feeds with a trip-updates URL and no auth requirement enter the poll
rotation (see `SourceState` below).

New catalog sources should implement the `GtfsCatalogProvider` trait
(`catalogs/catalog.rs`) and be added as a `CatalogSource` variant in `main.rs`.

### The dynamic polling scheduler (`scheduler.rs`) — the core

This is where the "big picture" lives; understanding it requires reading
`scheduler.rs` together with `delay.rs`.

- **Each feed runs as its own async task** (`run_feed`), looping "poll, then
  sleep its current interval". There's no shared queue or worker pool; instead a
  `tokio::sync::Semaphore` of `MAX_CONCURRENT_POLLS` permits caps how many feed
  fetches are in flight at once (networking is the bottleneck). The CPU-bound
  decode + delay computation — plus the one-time static→SQLite import and the
  per-poll schedule queries — is handed to `spawn_blocking` so it never stalls the
  runtime.
- Each feed carries **its own poll interval**. A feed is polled every
  `BASE_INTERVAL` (20s) while one of its vehicles sits in the global top
  `LEADERBOARD_SIZE` (25); when it drops out, the interval doubles each miss up
  to `MAX_INTERVAL` (5 min); the moment it re-enters the top, it snaps back to
  base. This is the whole point of the design — quiet feeds cost almost no
  network.
- The **top-25 membership signal drives three decisions at once**: the fast poll
  interval, lazy static-GTFS loading, and fetching **live vehicle positions**.
  `leaderboard_contains` answers "is this feed hot?" with an allocation-free O(n)
  count (how many trips beat this feed's best), not a sort — it runs on every poll.
  When a feed is hot, `update_vehicle_positions` also fetches its GTFS-realtime
  `VehiclePositions` feed and stores per-`trip_id` coordinates (`positions`); the
  leaderboard snapshot joins those onto each entry's `latitude`/`longitude` so the
  frontend can map the delayed vehicle. Fetching only for hot feeds keeps this off
  the ~1200 cold feeds. (`(0,0)` "null island" fixes are dropped in `delay.rs`.)
  `update_vehicle_positions` also **verifies each ranked trip is on its route**:
  a trip whose live vehicle sits more than `OFF_ROUTE_KM` (2km) from its shape
  (`distance_to_path_km`, point-to-segment) is a mismatched trip/vehicle and is
  dropped from the board, so it never reaches the leaderboard. `poll_once` therefore
  recomputes hotness *after* fetching positions: a feed whose only delayed trips
  were off-route drops out of the top N and backs off. A feed with trip updates but
  **no vehicle-positions feed** can't be verified this way, so it's excluded from
  polling entirely (`SourceState::NoVehiclePositions`) — only ~6% of feeds.
- A single `run_ticker` task renders the leaderboard every `PRINT_INTERVAL` (15s).
- The scheduler also tracks **per-source health** (`SourceRuntime`, parallel to
  `configs`): state, current interval, last poll outcome, live vehicle count, peak,
  hot flag, `late_trips` (how many delayed trips the last poll produced — a
  found-late count surfaced on the status page so a big agency stuck at 0 stands
  out as suspicious), `vetted_out` (how many late trips the delay history refused
  to vouch for on that poll — see below), and a transient `loading` flag (set only while the source is
  actively downloading + importing its static GTFS — a census count or a full
  load — so the status page can show that work in progress; orthogonal to
  `state`). `SourceState` is one of `Active` (in the poll rotation), `RequiresAuth`
  (auth-gated, never polled), `NoRealtime` (a static-only feed with no realtime to
  poll — see below), `NoVehiclePositions` (has trip updates but no vehicle-positions
  feed to verify routes against, so excluded), or `Failed(status)`. A poll that returns a `FATAL_STATUSES`
  code (401/404) retires the source: state → `Failed`, board cleared, and its task
  ends (never rescheduled). Only `Active` sources are polled (`pollable()`).
  `status_report()` serializes all this (plus each source's `total_trips`) for
  `/status`, but **trims the `NoRealtime` feeds to the largest `NO_REALTIME_DISPLAY`
  (100) by `total_trips`** — so the status page highlights the biggest agencies
  we're missing realtime for, not every tiny static-only feed. `total_sources` in
  the summary reflects what's actually shown.
- A background **maintenance task** (`run_maintenance`, concurrency
  `STATIC_FETCH_CONCURRENCY`, separate from the poll limiter) does two jobs. Its
  first pass is a one-time **census** that gives *every* agency a `total_trips`
  scale metric by downloading its static zip once and counting distinct `trip_id`s
  (`gtfs::count_trips`) — cheap, retaining nothing in memory. This is also what
  sizes the `NoRealtime` feeds so `status_report` can rank them. Every later pass
  (`MAINTENANCE_INTERVAL`, 1h) re-fetches and re-counts only *polled* feeds whose
  cached zip has gone stale past `gtfs::STATIC_TTL` (24h), and drops their loaded
  parsed copy so the next hot poll reloads from the fresh zip — keeping static
  schedules from drifting out of sync with the realtime feeds. `NoRealtime` feeds
  are counted once and then never refreshed (there's no realtime to desync from).
  Staleness is judged by the cached file's **mtime**, so it holds across
  restarts/downtime; cache writes are atomic (temp file + rename) so concurrent
  fetches can't corrupt a zip.
- The ticker also pushes a fresh `LeaderboardSnapshot` to any connected websocket
  clients on the same `PRINT_INTERVAL` (15s) tick, via a `tokio::sync::broadcast`
  channel — so the websocket is throttled to one update every 15s no matter how
  often feeds poll (a new client also gets one snapshot immediately on connect).
  It's gated on `receiver_count() > 0`, so it costs nothing when nobody is
  subscribed.
- Shared mutable state (`boards`, `static_gtfs`, `status`) uses plain
  `std::sync::Mutex`, never held across an `.await` — so the per-feed task futures
  stay `Send` and the locks stay cheap.

Tuning constants (intervals, max concurrent polls, leaderboard size, cache dir)
are module constants at the top of `scheduler.rs`.

### The two halves: static (`../static/`) and dynamic (this crate)

The deployment is **split to save money**. The pages are static and go on **GitHub
Pages** (free); this server goes on a **VPS**, which bills **egress**. So the split
is drawn at exactly that line: anything that never changes is served by the free
half, and the paid half serves only what can't be precomputed — the live board,
source health, a route shape.

`../static/` (a sibling of `server/`, and the GitHub Pages root) holds
`index.html`, `status.html`, and `config.js` — the one file that changes at deploy
time, holding the API origin. There is **no build step** and nothing is
`include_str!`-baked into the binary any more: the server serves no HTML at all,
only `/api/*`, so `/` and `/status` are 404s. Because the pages come from a
different origin, `api.rs` mounts a `CorsLayer` (any origin — nothing we serve is
private) and a `CompressionLayer` (br/gzip). See `../static/README.md` for the
deploy steps; the API must be **https**, or the browser blocks the calls as mixed
content.

### Bytes on the wire (`wire.rs`) — read before adding an endpoint

**Egress is the bill.** The naive version of this API cost ~7.6 GB/day *per open
status tab*: the page re-polled a 176 KB report every 2 seconds. Nothing about that
report justified it — between two ticks, a handful of feeds had been polled and the
other ~495 were byte-identical.

So both live streams push **deltas**, at two levels: a row that didn't change isn't
sent, and a row that did carries only the **fields** that changed. The client holds
the last full state and merges (`{...old, ...new}`). `wire.rs` is the shared
machinery (`DeltaStream`), and its module doc is the protocol spec. The parts worth
knowing before you touch it:

- Every message carries a `seq`; a delta also carries the `base` seq it was diffed
  against. **No `base` means a full.** The client's rule: `seq <= mine` → ignore;
  `base > mine` → a tick was missed, resync from a full; else merge. This is what
  makes the connect race benign — a full fetched over HTTP can legitimately be
  *newer* than the first delta that arrives on the socket.
- **One delta serves every client**, because they all received the same previous
  tick. That's what keeps the fan-out a single `broadcast` rather than a
  per-connection diff.
- The tick advances **whether or not anyone is listening**. The stream's retained
  state is what the *next* client is served as its full, so skipping the work when
  idle would just hand the next visitor a stale board.
- A field that changes **to null must travel as an explicit `null`**, or the merge
  keeps the stale value (a `last_error` that cleared, a vehicle that lost its GPS
  fix). Nulls are only stripped from rows the client has never seen.
- `SourceStatus.last_poll` is a **unix timestamp, not an age** — this is load-bearing.
  An age changes every tick for every source, so no row would ever be unchanged and
  the whole delta scheme would collapse back into re-sending the report. The page
  subtracts it from the message's `generated_at`.

Measured, at 504 sources: status **7.6 GB/day → ~105 MB/day** per viewer (and that
was during warmup, when every feed still polls at the 20s base interval — it settles
lower as feeds back off); leaderboard **52 → 22 MB/day**; a route shape
**27 KB → 2.4 KB**.

### The API layer + frontend (`api.rs`, `../static/`)

A thin axum server over the shared `Arc<Scheduler>`. No pages, five data endpoints:

- `GET /api/status` — the **full** `StatusReport` (per-source health: fetch
  frequency, success/failure, vehicles now, `total_trips` scale metric,
  `requires_auth` / `no_realtime` / `no_vehicle_positions` / `failed` state, plus an
  aggregate `summary`) with the `seq` a client needs before deltas mean anything.
  The `no_realtime` lines are the 100 biggest agencies the catalog lacks realtime
  for. **Fetched once per page load, not polled.** It's ~140 KB, which is precisely
  why it's on HTTP — the compression layer takes it to ~17 KB, and a websocket frame
  gets no compression.
- `WS /api/status/live` — source-health deltas, one every `STATUS_INTERVAL` (2s).
  Sends nothing on connect; the page already has its full.
- `WS /api/subscribe` — the leaderboard: a full board on connect, then a delta every
  `PRINT_INTERVAL` (15s). A client that lags past the broadcast buffer is
  **disconnected** rather than skipped — skipping a delta would leave its merged
  copy silently holding stale fields — and reconnects into a fresh full.
- `GET /api/shape/{slug}/{trip_id}` — one trip's route path as a **Google encoded
  polyline** (`wire::encode_polyline`), not an array of coordinate pairs: a shape is
  hundreds-to-thousands of points, and delta-encoding consecutive ones costs ~2 chars
  apiece instead of ~11 (measured 8.9× smaller raw, still 3× after gzip). Cached by
  the browser for a day — but **never when empty**, since "static isn't loaded yet"
  is a passing state and caching it would leave the map blank long after the shape
  exists.
- `POST /api/debug/capture` — **debug mode only** (see below). Body
  `{slug, trip_id, message}`; zips up everything behind one leaderboard entry into
  `./debug/` and returns `{ok, path, error}`. Errors (debug off, unknown slug)
  come back in the JSON body, not as an HTTP error, so the page shows them inline.

The two HTML pages are plain vanilla-JS, no build step. The leaderboard page renders
the merged board as three stacked sections — the **#1 row**, a **Leaflet map** of one
delayed vehicle (using the snapshot's `latitude`/`longitude`), then the
**#2–25 rows**. **Up/down buttons** above the map step a *selected index* through
the leaderboard, so the map + detail line can show any ranked trip, not just #1
(the selection is clamped to the current board and persists across the 15s
pushes). The map re-centers its single marker on each tick and draws the
selected vehicle's **route line**, fetched on demand from
`GET /api/shape/{slug}/{trip_id}` → `Gtfs::trip_shape`, which returns the trip's
**own** `shape_id` (the accurate path for that run), falling back to the
**canonical** shape for its route + direction only when the trip has no shape of
its own. Each row's **Watched** column (and the map caption) shows the entry's
provenance — how long we've tracked the trip and how much of its lateness it picked
up *while we watched* — from the snapshot's `tracked_seconds` / `birth_delay_seconds`
(see the delay-provenance section). These are receipts, not a caveat: everything on
the board has already passed the vetting gate.

**Debug mode** (`AMD_DEBUG` env var — any value but empty/`0`/`false`/`no`; a
runtime flag, not a build flag, so it costs a single bool check when off and no
work until a capture is triggered) surfaces a per-row 🐛 **capture** column on the
leaderboard page. The snapshot carries `debug_enabled` so the frontend reveals the
column (CSS `body.debug-on`). Clicking prompts for a free-text note and POSTs to
`/api/debug/capture`; `Scheduler::capture_debug` **over-collects** (deliberately —
this is a developer tool, never user-facing) into a zip: the agency config +
per-source health, the **live re-fetched** trip-updates and vehicle-positions
feeds (raw `.pb` bytes *and* a decoded pretty-print, plus the just-this-trip
subset), the recomputed `DelayedTrip` + leaderboard entry, the trip's static
schedule rows (`Gtfs::debug_dump`), and a verbatim copy of the cached static GTFS
zip **and** SQLite index. The realtime feeds are re-fetched *at capture time* so
the archive reflects the feed state when the anomaly is visible, not whenever the
report is later opened. Archives can be large (hundreds of MB for a big agency,
since the zip + sqlite are both included and the decoded dump is verbose); `./debug/`
is git-ignored.

The status page fetches `/api/status` once and then follows `/api/status/live`, and
shows both a grid of square LEDs (color = state — with a pulsing cyan taking
precedence while a source is downloading/importing its static GTFS — ring =
on-leaderboard, one-shot blink = freshly polled, custom hover tooltip) and a
**sortable table** of the same data (click a column header; only the status cell is
tinted). The LED grid is kept in the **same order as the table**, so re-sorting the
table re-sorts the dots. Three of its columns (`status`, `age`, `hot`) are *derived*
client-side rather than sent — `age` most of all, see the `wire.rs` section. Edit
the pages under `../static/`; there's nothing to rebuild. Note: the leaderboard map
is the one place we load **external resources** (Leaflet + OpenStreetMap tiles from
a CDN — someone else's bandwidth, deliberately); the status page stays
self-contained.

The serializable public types (`LeaderboardSnapshot`, `StatusReport`, etc.) live
in `scheduler.rs` so the scheduler stays the single source of truth; `api.rs` only
does HTTP/WS plumbing, and `wire.rs` owns the delta format.

### Delay provenance (`history.rs`) — why the top entries are real

Read this before touching `delay.rs`. Every fake that has ever topped the board has
one shape: **the feed hands us a `trip_id` that no longer describes the run the
vehicle is driving.** MARTA's AVL finishes a bus's 10:22 run, sends it back out on
its 12:22 run, and keeps labelling it `11012496`; we compare a 12:40 bus against a
10:22 timetable and get a fake two hours. LADOT does the same via a stale block
assignment. In a *single frame* these are indistinguishable from a genuinely late
bus — predictions self-consistent, vehicle on its route, stop interior. And
"re-match the vehicle to its best-fitting scheduled trip" (what Transit appears to
do) is **worse than useless here**: it computes delay *modulo the headway*, so a bus
one headway late reports ~0 — it destroys precisely the large delays this project
exists to find. Don't reintroduce it.

Across *time* they separate trivially, because delay obeys a physical bound: **a
trip's delay can grow no faster than the clock.** A bus stuck motionless accumulates
one second of lateness per second; nothing accumulates more. So `TripHistory::vet`
(called on every poll, per feed) keeps a `TripTrack` per live `trip_id` and applies
three rules:

1. **Birth** — a trip first seen more than `CREDIBLE_BIRTH_DELAY` (10m) late is never
   credited. We have no evidence its delay is real rather than a stale label; and a
   run that never departed is a *cancellation* to the rider, not a two-hour ride.
2. **Growth** — delay may exceed neither `last_delay + elapsed` nor
   `birth_delay + age`, each plus `JUMP_SLACK` (15m, since a prediction may be
   revised in one step). The first catches a label flipping mid-run (MARTA jumps
   +121m between two polls ≤5m apart — not implausible but *impossible*); the second
   stops per-poll slack compounding into a large fake.
3. **Direction** — a trip's current stop never moves meaningfully backwards through
   its own sequence (`SEQ_TOLERANCE`, 3). A bus does not un-drive its route; MARTA's
   jumps from stop 68 to stop 2.

A violation is **sticky** — after a label goes stale the delays it reports are steady
and self-consistent, so re-testing each poll would let the fake straight back in. A
trip absent for `ABSENCE_RESET` (20m) is instead *forgotten* and, on return, must be
born credible again — which is exactly how LADOT's bus, reappearing mislabelled
mid-way through a later run, gets refused. Forgetting is also what bounds the memory
(only trips seen in the last 20 minutes are held).

This is why `delay::delayed_trips` returns a `FeedDelays` — the late `trips`, *and* a
`TripObservation` for **every** trip it could time, late or not. The on-time sightings
are the whole point: they're the evidence that lets the same trip be believed when it
later turns up an hour down. Keep observations cheap (no label lookups); only the
rankable trips get `describe`d.

Two accepted costs, both deliberate: after a restart nothing has history, so the board
fills over the first several minutes (capped near `CREDIBLE_BIRTH_DELAY` at first)
rather than instantly; and a genuinely late-*starting* run never scores. Each ranked
entry carries its receipts (`tracked_seconds`, `birth_delay_seconds`) into the
snapshot, and the leaderboard's **Watched** column shows them; `/status` shows
`vetted_out` per source.

### Realtime, static, and delay computation

- `realtime.rs`: async fetch + protobuf-decode of a GTFS-realtime feed
  (`fetch_feed` — used for both TripUpdates and VehiclePositions).
- `gtfs.rs`: async-downloads (and disk-caches to `./feeds/<slug>.zip`) the
  **static** GTFS schedule, then — on the blocking pool (`spawn_blocking`) — imports
  it **once** into a per-feed **SQLite** database (`./feeds/<slug>.sqlite`, via
  `rusqlite` with the `bundled` feature). Every schedule query (route/stop names,
  scheduled arrival times, trip rows, route shapes) is then an **indexed lookup
  straight off disk** through a read-only `Connection` (wrapped in a `Mutex` so
  `Arc<Gtfs>` stays `Send + Sync` for the blocking pool; each loaded feed has its own
  connection, so they never contend). The point is memory: the big tables
  (`stop_times`, `shapes` — millions of rows on large feeds) **never live on the
  heap**; SQLite pages them in on demand under a small `cache_size` pragma, so a
  loaded feed's resident footprint is flat and bounded. We trade a little disk (the
  `.sqlite` sidecar) for that.

  **Memory tuning — read before changing it, it's all measured.** The one term that
  scaled with feeds *loaded* was the per-connection page cache: at 2 MiB each it
  measured **~2.8 MB of heap per loaded feed**, making SQLite ~32% of RSS at 141
  feeds and heading for ~800 MB across every feed. Three levers, all now in
  `gtfs.rs`: `PAGE_CACHE_KIB` (256 KiB per connection, down from 2 MiB — the pages
  stay hot in the *kernel's* page cache, which is shared, evictable, and not charged
  to our RSS, so this mostly moves caching somewhere strictly better);
  `SQLITE_HEAP_LIMIT` (a **global** `sqlite3_soft_heap_limit64` backstop, so the sum
  across all connections is bounded directly rather than trusting N per-connection
  budgets to add up); and `MMAP_BYTES`, which is **deliberately 0** — see its doc
  comment, mmap charged 657 MB of mapped pages to our RSS and the kernel caches those
  file pages anyway. Net at 141 feeds: **RSS 568→395 MB, SQLite heap 181→28 MB**,
  and SQLite no longer grows with feeds loaded. `/status`'s summary reports
  `sqlite_bytes` / `sqlite_peak_bytes` / `process_rss_bytes` so this stays checkable
  instead of guessed at.

  Things that sound good here and **aren't**: consolidating the per-feed databases
  into one file (either a table per feed, or one table with a `dataset_id`) — a
  per-feed table explodes the schema every connection must parse, and a shared table
  makes `stop_times` tens of millions of rows (deeper B-trees ⇒ *more* pages touched
  per lookup), serializes all imports behind one writer, turns a feed refresh into a
  multi-million-row `DELETE` needing a multi-GB `VACUUM`, and puts every agency in one
  blast radius — to optimize a term that is now ~7% of RSS. `WAL` buys nothing (after
  import we are strictly read-only, and WAL exists to let readers run alongside a
  writer). `VACUUM` is disk, not RSS, and the DBs are bulk-loaded once into a fresh
  file, so they're already compact.

  `Gtfs` itself holds only the connection + the
  agency timezone (resolved once at load). Import streams each CSV member row-by-row
  into prepared inserts (never collecting a whole table), with secondary indexes on
  `stop_times`/`shapes` built after the bulk load; the `time` column bakes in
  arrival-else-departure. The `.sqlite` is **derived from the cached zip** and
  rebuilt only when the zip is newer (mtime check) or the db is missing — so the
  zip download/refresh/census path is untouched, and a maintenance refresh (which
  re-downloads a newer zip) transparently triggers a rebuild on the next load. The
  zip disk cache is mtime-TTL'd (`STATIC_TTL`, 24h) and written atomically.

  **A 200 OK is not a GTFS zip** (`looks_like_zip`, checked before anything is
  cached). Plenty of agencies answer a zip request with `200` carrying HTML (a login
  page, a CDN 404, a "lander" redirect), JSON, an empty body, or a plain-text error —
  the Availtec/InfoPoint stack behind The Rapid and TARC literally returns *"Failed
  response to GTFS-Zip request: Reason=The process cannot access the file … because it
  is being used by another process"*. `error_for_status()` waves all of that through.
  Writing it to `<slug>.zip` **poisons the cache**: because freshness is judged by
  mtime, the junk is trusted for a full 24h, so a momentary file-lock upstream takes
  the agency dark for a day. (15 of ~200 cached zips were poisoned this way when the
  check was added.) So: verify the ZIP signature before caching and `bail!` with a
  `body_preview` of what the server actually said — nothing is written, and the next
  pass retries — and verify it again on the way *out* of the cache, discarding a
  poisoned entry so an already-corrupted cache self-heals rather than staying dark.
  Don't "simplify" either check away; a truthful HTTP status is not something these
  feeds reliably provide.

  `count_trips` counts a schedule's trips straight from the zip without building the
  index (for the census). `is_stale` is the shared freshness check. A static URL
  with a `#inner.zip` fragment (a GTFS zip nested inside another zip — e.g. SEPTA's
  `gtfs_public.zip#google_bus.zip`) is **unwrapped at download time** so the cache
  always holds a flat GTFS zip.
- `delay.rs`: turns a realtime feed into a `FeedDelays` — the late `DelayedTrip`s
  (fully labelled, leaderboard candidates) **plus a `TripObservation` for every trip
  it could time at all**, late or not, which is what `history.rs` needs (see above;
  the vetting gate is what actually decides which of these reach the board). Trips
  are `measure_delay`d cheaply and only the rankable ones are `describe`d, so the
  label lookups stay off the ~40k vehicles we see per cycle. **Static GTFS is
  optional here** — `delayed_trips` takes `Option<&Gtfs>`. Delay is derived by
  priority: (1) `TripUpdate.delay`, (2) `StopTimeEvent.delay`, (3)
  predicted-vs-static-schedule comparison. Only (3) needs the static feed, so a
  leaderboard can be built from realtime signals alone. This is why the scheduler
  can defer static loading until a feed is actually interesting: static feeds are
  large, and eagerly parsing hundreds of them would blow up memory and startup.
  The delay is read at the trip's **`current_stop`** — the stop whose predicted
  time is closest to *now*, i.e. where the vehicle physically is — not the next
  future stop, because some feeds emit corrupt *downstream* predictions (a stop
  flung hours out of position with a matching multi-hour delay) while the
  just-reached stop still reads correctly (this is what pinned King County Metro
  at a fake ~4h). The **next** stop is still what we *display* (`upcoming_stop`).
  `current_stop` also drops **stale "ghost" trips**: if even the nearest predicted
  stop is more than `STALE_PREDICTION_SECS` (1h) from now, the trip is a completed
  run the feed never expired (many feeds leave these in TripUpdates with all stops
  hours in the past) — its bogus timestamps would otherwise schedule-compare into
  huge fake delays (this is what put Santa Maria Area Transit's ghosts at a fake
  ~8h #1). A genuinely late bus, however late, is still at some stop *now*, so this
  never suppresses a real delay. Trips late by ≤0 are dropped, as are over-long
  ones — but with **two ceilings**: agency-*reported* delays (trip/stop-level) get
  the generous `MAX_PLAUSIBLE_DELAY` (8h), while *inferred* schedule-comparison
  delays get the tighter `MAX_INFERRED_DELAY` (3h), since a realtime `trip_id` that
  maps to a different scheduled trip (id/block reuse) or a service-date edge makes
  an on-time bus look uniformly hours late — a fake the ghost check can't catch
  (a stop still sits near now) but that a real agency would have reported directly.
  A delay read at either of the trip's **terminal stops** — origin or destination —
  is dropped outright, **whatever its source** (`at_terminal_stop` /
  `Gtfs::terminal_stops`, checked in `measure_delay` before any delay is derived).
  A vehicle parked at an endpoint is not a delayed bus: at the origin it simply never
  departed (a *cancellation* to the rider, not an hours-long ride), and at the
  destination it's a finished run whose timestamps are going stale. Both sit still
  while their reported delay climbs at a **full second per second** — the fastest any
  delay can grow — so they *out-grow every real bus and win the leaderboard*: with
  the provenance gate in place but this check still limited to inferred delays, the
  board's top was Cleveland parked at stop 1 of 98 and NJ Transit at stop 51 of 52,
  each reporting a `stop-level`/`trip-level` delay that sailed past a guard that only
  ran for `vs-schedule`. (It also pinned MARTA at a fake ~2h that the 3h ceiling let
  through.) A genuinely late bus is underway at an *interior* stop, so refusing the
  endpoints costs no real delay. Duplicate trips are also
  collapsed: some feeds emit the same `trip_id` as several entities in one message
  (OCTA repeats a trip up to 3×), so `delayed_trips` keeps one `DelayedTrip` per
  trip id (the largest delay) rather than showing duplicate leaderboard rows.
  `delay.rs` also exposes
  `vehicle_positions` (a `FeedMessage` → per-`trip_id` coordinates map), used to
  place hot feeds' delayed vehicles on the map, and `needs_static_schedule` (see
  the scheduler's static-load bootstrap below).

## Gotchas

- **Adding a field to a live payload costs egress on every viewer, forever.** The
  streams are deltas (`wire.rs`), so a field that changes *rarely* is nearly free
  and a field that changes *every tick* is expensive — it drags its whole row onto
  the wire each time. A field that changes every tick **for every row** (an age, a
  countdown, a "seconds since") is the pathological case: it defeats the row-level
  delta entirely and puts the full report back on the wire. Send the underlying
  timestamp and derive it in the page, as `last_poll` does. Same rule for a new
  endpoint: if a page would poll it on a timer, it should probably be a delta stream
  instead.
- **The leaderboard is cold after a restart, and that's correct.** Delay provenance
  (`history.rs`) only credits lateness it *watched accumulate*, and a fresh process
  has watched nothing — so for the first minutes the board is capped near
  `CREDIBLE_BIRTH_DELAY` (10m) and every entry reads "born ~9m late, watched ~1m".
  It climbs as trips are picked up on time and get worse under observation; a 60m
  entry needs ~45m of continuous observation of that trip. Don't "fix" this by
  loosening the birth rule — a board that fills instantly after a restart is a board
  that trusts delays it has no evidence for, which is precisely how the MARTA and
  LADOT fakes got to #1. If you need a populated board immediately (a demo), let it
  warm up rather than raising the constants.
- The ceilings in `delay.rs` (`MAX_PLAUSIBLE_DELAY`, `MAX_INFERRED_DELAY`), the
  terminal-stop rule, and the `STALE_PREDICTION_SECS` ghost check are now **backstops
  behind** the provenance gate, not the primary defense — they were each added to
  catch a specific fake from a single frame. They could probably be relaxed now, but
  they're cheap and independent, so they stay.
- Delay computation degrades gracefully without static GTFS, but a feed that
  *only* exposes schedule-comparison delays (neither delay field populated) reports
  nothing until its static feed loads — and static normally only loads once a feed
  reaches the top 25, which such a feed can never do without delays. The scheduler
  breaks this chicken-and-egg with a **one-shot eager static load**: when a poll
  yields zero delays and `delay::needs_static_schedule` says the feed is
  times-only, `poll_once` calls `ensure_static_loaded` so the *next* poll can
  schedule-compare (this is how MBTA, TTC, Capital Metro, VIA Metro… surface at
  all). Reaching the top 25 is therefore no longer a prerequisite for these
  agencies — but it does mean big time-only feeds each build their SQLite index
  early, so warmup does more one-time import work (and writes more `.sqlite` to
  disk) up front. That's disk and CPU, not resident memory: the imported schedule
  lives on disk and is queried, never held in RAM (see `gtfs.rs`).
- Dropping the country filter in `main.rs` is why ~600 agencies are monitored
  rather than only US ones; scope the filter there if that changes.
- The shared reqwest client sends a real `User-Agent` (`USER_AGENT` in
  `scheduler.rs`). Some hosts (e.g. viainfo.net, serving VIA Metropolitan's static
  GTFS) return **403 Forbidden** to a client with no UA, which silently starved
  those agencies of a `total_trips` census. Keep a UA set on any new outbound
  client.
